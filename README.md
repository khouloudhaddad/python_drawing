# üê¢ Python Turtle Graphics Project
Welcome to the Python Turtle Graphics project! This project demonstrates the power of Python's turtle module to create interactive, graphical shapes and designs using simple code.

## üéØ Project Overview
In this project, we use Python's turtle graphics library to draw various shapes, patterns, and designs. The turtle module is an excellent way to visualize programming concepts and introduce creative coding in Python. This project is perfect for beginners to learn basic Python concepts like loops, functions, and conditionals in a fun and interactive way.

## ‚ú® Features
- Draw geometric shapes such as squares, triangles, circles, etc.
- Create colorful designs and patterns with randomization
- Use loops and recursion to generate complex fractal-like patterns
- User interaction to control drawing (keyboard or mouse)
- Save the generated images

## üöÄ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website.

```
# Check Python version
python --version
```
### Installation
1- Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-turtle-project.git
```
2- Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd python-turtle-project
```
3- Install any required packages (if any):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Note:** The turtle module comes pre-installed with Python, so no extra installation is necessary unless you add more dependencies.

### Running the Project
To run the Turtle graphics code, simply execute the Python script:

```
python turtle_art.py
```
Watch as the turtle creates beautiful patterns on the screen!


## üõ†Ô∏è Customization
Feel free to experiment with the code. Modify the shapes, colors, and patterns by adjusting the parameters in the functions. You can even add new features like user inputs, dynamic shapes, or animations.

## ü§ù Contributing
